## What is Code Kuma?

Code Kuma is a friendly, casual hack session targetted at people at any skill level who would like to code or learn to code. 

There is no set agenda for Code Kuma, ideally you would bring along your own project to work on, or find someone at the event who'd 
be interested in having some help (There will be a pin-board and cards where you can put up a project you're looking for volunteers
to help on).

Are you totally new to programming? Pomke and Liza are here to help, we can help you get a programming language installed on your
computer, point you to some great tutorials, and even give you a bit of a kickstart with a brief intro to programming if you'd like ^_^
